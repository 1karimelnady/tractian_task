Performance Optimization
I would implement data caching and lazy loading to reduce API calls and improve app responsiveness, especially when switching between companies or applying filters.

Test Coverage
Adding unit tests and integration tests to ensure long-term maintainability and reduce the risk of regressions during future development.

Scalability & Architecture
Iâ€™d consider refining the project structure by introducing a more modular architecture (e.g., clean architecture or feature-based organization) to better support future scalability and team collaboration.
